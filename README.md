- **Data Fetching**: The project fetches data from JSON files to simulate a server, providing dynamic content for service centers.
- **Interceptor Cache**: Utilizes an interceptor to cache fetched data, enhancing the overall performance and reducing server requests.
- **City and Activities Filter**: Users can choose a city and activities, and the service centers in the selected city offering the specified activities will be displayed.
- **Service Components**: The project demonstrates the use of services for data handling and separation between smart and dumb (stupid) components.
- **Angular Utilities**: Leverages various Angular utilities for efficient development.
